# Initial Setup Implementation

## Overview

Implemented automatic initial setup for the vibe-kanban application that runs when the database is empty. The system will automatically seed default categories, settings, and user preferences on first startup.

## Implementation

### 1. InitialSetupService (Domain Layer)

Location: `backend/src/domain/services/InitialSetupService.ts`

- **Purpose**: Detects empty database and triggers initial setup
- **Key Methods**:
  - `isDatabaseEmpty()`: Checks if both categories and transactions tables are empty
  - `performInitialSetupIfNeeded()`: Main orchestration method that runs setup if needed
  - `seedDefaults()`: Delegates to SeedController for actual seeding

### 2. Enhanced SeedController (Infrastructure Layer)

Location: `backend/src/infrastructure/controllers/SeedController.ts`

- **Enhancement**: Added `performReset()` method for programmatic access
- **Purpose**: Allows internal calls without HTTP request/response dependencies
- **Data Seeded**:
  - 21 default categories (Essential, Discretionary, Income, Investment, Debt Payment)
  - 4 default app settings (currency, date range, auto-categorization, duplicate detection)
  - Default user preferences (EUR currency, English, light theme)

### 3. Application Integration

Location: `backend/src/main.ts`

- **Integration Point**: Application startup, after database connection
- **Behavior**:
  - Checks database status on every startup
  - Only runs setup if database is completely empty
  - Logs setup progress with console messages
  - Exits application if setup fails

## Features

- **Zero-configuration**: Users get a working system immediately
- **Safe**: Only runs on empty databases, won't override existing data
- **Reuses existing logic**: Leverages the existing reset functionality
- **Follows DDD principles**: Proper separation of concerns
- **Error handling**: Comprehensive error handling with Result pattern
- **Logging**: Clear console feedback during setup process

## Usage

When starting the application with an empty database:

```bash
npm run dev
```

You'll see:

```
ðŸš€ Database is empty, performing initial setup...
âœ… Initial setup completed successfully
âœ… Server is running!
```

## Testing

The implementation has been validated for:

- TypeScript compilation
- Proper dependency injection
- Error handling paths
- Integration with existing codebase patterns

Users now start with a fully configured system instead of empty data, providing immediate value and better onboarding experience.
